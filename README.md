## üöÄ Project Description

**HSM-BANK-LTD** simulates a real-world banking system with a user-friendly web interface and robust backend services. This project integrates:

- A **responsive frontend** developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for seamless user interaction.
- A **backend** powered by **C++ CGI scripts**, providing fast, efficient, and secure server-side processing.
- A **MySQL database** to store user credentials, account information, and transaction records reliably.

Users can register accounts, log in securely, manage account details, perform transactions like fund transfers, and review their transaction history ‚Äî all within a cohesive, full-stack environment.

This project highlights the power of C++ on the server side combined with standard web technologies and SQL database management, serving as a practical example of full-stack development beyond common languages like Python or Node.js.
